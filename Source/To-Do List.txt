
NEED TO Figure Out How to Hook & Launch the Windows 7 (and Vista???) Calendar Window/Dialog.

Store Configuration Data in (alternate) .ini File - As Option.

REQUESTED .ini Based Portable Version.

ADD Time Difference (from TClock Lite)

Show Active Alarms in Context Menu

NEED TO ADD/Fix Clock Face/Font(size) Recalculation when Line Number X/Y/W/H is Changed 

NEED TO FIX - Switching From Single to Multi Line Format Doesn't Display
				New Line Without First Toggling the Font Size, Why?
	
Can we Control T-Clock's Volume Individually...?

Can we ADD - Shutdown/Startup Event/Timer Option.

Add TClockEx Feature: ZZ = 3 character TimeZone Code in Custom Format String.
	This is/was a complete and total catastrophe (May try it again later)

NEED TO ADD: CommandLine /Switch Option to Mouse Click Run App X Feature.

Requests: From DC Member: freaky44
- It would be great to have the option to see the size and number of files of
  the recycle bin in the Mouse-over Tooltip Text. (e.g. "10 Files, 135 MB").

- I would love to have the option to set the action in mouse-properties to
  "open files/folders (with command-line switches)". Just like you can do
  it in the "Menu Item Details". Then i could empty/open the recycle bin
  with just one click.

NEED Adjustable Blink Color (and Blink Test) - Defaults cause the blink to be transparent.
